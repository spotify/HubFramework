 *  Class used to define atomic bodies of work as operations, that can either be synchronous or asynchronous
 *
 *  Why not use `NSOperations`? While `NSOperations` are great for scheduling work on background threads and
 *  dealing with other forms of asynchronosity and managing dependencies between various tasks, they're very
 *  cumbersome (& overkill) to use for simple operations that always should be executed in sequence on the
 *  same thread. If this operation implementation ever becomes more complex, and in the need for some of the
 *  features that `NSOperations` offers, we should totally replace it.

/**
 *  Protocol implemented by objects that manage a Hub Framework component
 *
 *  A component acts as a controller between a `HUBComponentModel` and a `UIView` that should be added
 *  to the screen by the Hub Framework. Its responsibilities include model->view data binding, event
 *  handling and rendering.
 *
 *  You are free to implement your component in whatever way you desire, and register it for use with
 *  the Hub Framework using a `HUBComponentFactory` implementation registered with `HUBComponentRegistry`.
 *
 *  Ideally, components should hold as little state as possible, and instead react to any model changes
 *  through `-configureViewWithModel:`. Components of the same class are also reused as much as possible,
 *  so a component can never assume a 1:1 relationship with a certain model, rather it needs to be able to
 *  render any `HUBComponentModel`.
 *
 *  This is the base protocol that all components must conform to. For extensions that adds additional
 *  functionality see:
 *
 *  `HUBComponentWithChildren`: For components that can contain nested child components
 *
 *  `HUBComponentWithImageHandling`: For handling downloaded images.
 *
 *  `HUBComponentWithRestorableUIState`: For saving & restoring the UI state of a component.
 *
 *  `HUBComponentWithSelectionState`: For responding to highlight & selection events in a component.
 *
 *  `HUBComponentWithFocusState`: For responding to focus events in a component (tvOS only).
 *
 *  `HUBComponentContentOffsetObserver`: For components that react to the view's content offset.
 *
 *  `HUBComponentViewObserver`: For components that observe their view for various events.
 *
 *  `HUBComponentActionPerformer`: For components that can perform actions (see `HUBAction`).
 *
 *  `HUBComponentActionObserver`: For components that can observe actions (see `HUBAction`).

 *  same view, or to the content edge of that view.
 *
 *  Please note that the layout traits this property contains may be used for another instance of the same

#pragma mark - Managing the View

/**
 *  The view that the component uses to render its content
 *
 *  This property should start out as `nil`, and when the Hub Framework will call `-loadView`
 *  on the component, the view should be loaded and this property assigned. This pattern works
 *  similar to the view loading mechanism of `UIViewController`.
 *
 *  The view will be resized by the Hub Framework, taking the size returned from the component's
 *  `-preferredViewSizeForDisplayingModel:containedInViewWithSize:` method into account.
 *
 *  A component has a 1:1 relationship with its view.

 *  The Hub Framework will send this message to a component when a new instance of it is about
 *  to be displayed. The component should at this point create its view, and assign it to its
 *  `view` property. When this method returns, the `view` property of the component must not
 *  be `nil`.
 *
 *  You don't have to set any particular frame for the view, since it will be resized and
 *  repositioned by the Hub Framework.

 *  depending on the component's `layoutTraits`.
 *
 *  To get notified when the component's view was resized, conform to `HUBComponentViewObserver`.

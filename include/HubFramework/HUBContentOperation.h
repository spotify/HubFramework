 *  operation is free to do its work in whatever way it desires, online or offline - manipulating a view's content
 *  either in code or through JSON (or another data format) - synchronously or asynchronously.
 *
 *  When a new view is about to be displayed by the Hub Framework, the framework will call the content operations
 *  associated with that view. The content that these content operations add to the used `HUBViewModelBuilder` will
 *  then be used to create a view model for the view.
 *
 *  If your content operation also has some initial content that can be synchronously added to the view, before the
 *  main content loading chain is started - it can conform to `HUBContentOperationWithInitialContent` to be able to
 *  do so.

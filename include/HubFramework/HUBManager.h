 *  @param componentFallbackHandler The object to use to fall back to default components in case a component couldn't be
 *         resolved using the standard mechanism. See `HUBComponentFallbackHandler` for more information.
 *  @param connectivityStateResolver An object responsible for determining the current connectivity state of the application.
 *         If nil, a default implementation will be used, that uses the SystemConfiguration framework to determine connectivity.
 *  @param imageLoaderFactory Any custom factory that creates image loaders that are used to load remote images for components.
 *         If nil, a default image loader factory will be used. See `HUBImageLoaderFactory` for more info.
 *  @param iconImageResolver Any object responsible for converting icons into renderable images. If nil, this instance of
 *         the Hub Framework won't support icons. See `HUBIconImageResolver` for more information.
 *  @param defaultActionHandler Any default action handler to use for features that do not define their own. An action handler
 *         enables execution of custom code instead of performing an action. See `HUBActionHandler` for more information.
 *  @param defaultContentReloadPolicy Any default content reload policy to use for features that do not define their own.
 *         A content reload policy determines whenever a view belonging to the feature should have its content reloaded.
 *         If nil, any feature not defining its own reload policy will always be reloaded whenever a view that belongs to
 *         it re-appears. See `HUBContentReloadPolicy` for more information.
 *  @param prependedContentOperationFactory Any content operation factory that should be prepended to the chain of content
 *         operation factories for all views. The operations that this factory produces will therefore always be prepended
 *         to the content loading chain of any view.
 *  @param appendedContentOperationFactory Any content operation factory that should be appended to the chain of content
 *         operation factories for all views. The operations that this factory produces will therefore always be appended
 *         to the content loading chain of any view.
 *
 *  In case you don't want to use all of these customization options, see the initializers available in `HUBManager+Convenience.h`.
